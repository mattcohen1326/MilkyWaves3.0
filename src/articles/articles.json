    "body": "Whats up,Welcome to Milky Waves, a blog focused on music, but certainly not limited to it.  In my free time since high school I have developed different designs, this being the third iteration.  I will post daily thoughts, new beats I have produced, and hopefully some other fun contributions from my friends. Please enjoy all we have to offer here at milkywaves.org, including the Playlist Picker; where you can get a playlist recommendation from our library of playlists which is always growing.  Please send feedback to milkywavesmusic@gmai.com including the name of the playlist and the category you thinks it belongs in, I will continue to tweak and improve the recommendations.Along with the music entries G’s Rule Book To The Galaxy, will keep things fun with general rules to follow for everybody’s sake.  Any guitar you hear on the original beats also comes from G and he will hopefully contribute all over the site. I have been in a coding frenzy trying to launch this site so I hope whoever is out there will find some enjoyment in the Milky Waves experience.  I look forward to always updating the site and bringing new content daily. Matt ",
